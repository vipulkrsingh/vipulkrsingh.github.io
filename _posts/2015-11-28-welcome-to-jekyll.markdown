Finally i decided to create a place to write about a thing or two. Jekyll comes to the rescue and how. Quick and flexible, just the way it ought to be.

As [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) puts it.

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a
> template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs
> it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and
> spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for
> serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the
> engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host
> your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

So i followed [this](https://pages.github.com) beautiful how-to guide by github and bam! the blog is here.

Next step is choosing a theme, the community comes to rescue with a bunch of cool themes, like this one i found on jekylltheme.org [here](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/daktilo/).  This elegant theme created by [Daktilo](https://github.com/kronik3r/daktilo) caught my attention. Daktilo had clear instructions about how to set it up and now i have a nice theme for the blog as well.

So here we go a blog, cool theme and an easy way to publish.
