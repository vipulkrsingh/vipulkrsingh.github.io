Basic Concepts

1. State Tree
   - Everything that changes in the application including data and UI states are stored in single object called state or state tree.
   - Is minimal representation of App 
2. State can only change by action
   - State is READ ONLY
   - Can be change by only dispatching an action
   - Action is a JavaScript object, describing in a minimal way what changed in an application
3. Pure functions 
   -  Should not do network call, db call, update DOM etc..
   - Should not modify the object that is passed.
4. Reducer Function
   - Takes previous state, action being dispatched and returns new state of the app
   - Has to be pure function
5. Properties of a reducer function
   - Should accept state and action as argument
   - Should return current state in case un-handled event type is recieved
   - Should return default state in case state is undefined.

example for a reducer

```
const counter = (state =0,action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```
