_` How long would it take you organization to deploy a change that involved just one line of code? Do you do this on a repeatable, relaible basis ? `_

_` Our highest priority is  to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software  - Agile Manifesto`_

Why release frequently ?
- Feedback from users
- Reduce risk of release
- real project progress

Fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of application everytime there is a change to code, infrastructure or configuration.

_` Cease dependence on mass inspection to achieve quality. Improve the process  and build quality into the product in the first place  - E Edwards Deming`_

Deployment Pipeline : An automated implementation of systems's build,deploy,test and release process.
