_` Prospect theory is a behavioral economic theory that describes the way people choose between probabilistic alternatives that involve risk, where the probabilities of outcomes are known. `_

- Frame is mental model about how things work in the world
- Framing a problem can have a big affect on the decision making.
- Notion of Loss vs gain has great impact
- People react differently when problem is framed with portential loss than potential gain
- Defining the problem (the language) dictates outcome!
- Opportunity vs Threat - changes decision making approach!
- Potential loss kindoff makes us take more risk.

* Situation - Unusual desease is spreading, about 600 people might be killed *

- Senario - 1
  - A : The solution A will save 200 people
  - B : With the solution B there is 1/3rd probability that all 600 will be save OR 2/3rd probability that no one is saved.
- Your Answer : ( Remember what you choose )

- Senario - 2
  - C : If we choose solution C, 400 will die
  - D : If we choose solution D. 1/3 probablity that No one Dies, but 2/3 probability that all 600 people die
- Your Answer : ( Compare with what you choose above )

- Organizations tend act rigidly when faced with threats
- But, act much more flexibly if problem is faced as opportunity
- Frame balancing is needed with respect to organization.
- Threat -> brings focus and more resources are channalised
- Opportunity -> Promotes lateral thinking and open to new ideas.
- Hard to shake mental models, can get outdated, needs to get challenged.
- Look into the assumptions behind mental models and challenge the assumptions.
- Try not to oversimplify situation while framing the problem

*` Better if we have competing frames to look at the problem. Power of competing frames is immense `*
